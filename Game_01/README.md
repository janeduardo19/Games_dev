## Project Idea
<p>
I am using this project to pratice every programming logic I find out, the main language is Java. I doing following a course, in this course we are doing a game engine in Java and learnig basic to advanced techniques for game development.
<br>
Every day I do more things and put updates in this project. So, if you want to
run this game, you can do a clone of this repo and run the project on eclipse
or other IDE.</p>
